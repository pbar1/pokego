# Generation 1 Battle Specification

This is a plain English explanation of the Pokemon gen 1 (RGBY) battle spec.
I've never seen this info collected together in total before.

Two players, with a team of between 1 and 6 Pokemon each, face each other with 1
Pokemon on the field at a time each. They compete to deplete the opponent's whole
team's HP first.
